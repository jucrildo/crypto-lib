# Crypto Lib
Cryptography library that contains some encryption algorithms in C

***Note: This project is still under development, including the DES algorithm.***

## Introduction
This pet project was intended to teach me about how encryption/decryption works, implementing some of the most known algorithms in C from scratch.

## Setup
To run it, just follow these commands:
```
$ make
$ ./des  
```
